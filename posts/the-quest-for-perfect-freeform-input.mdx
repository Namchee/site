If you've ever interacted with a website or an application on your smartphone, you should be
familiar with freeform text inputs.

Unlike the traditional text inputs, free-form text inputs are capable of handling reasonably sized
multi-line plain-text inputs which is perfect for comments, feedbacks or in recent cases, inputs
for chatbots.

In a context of a website, free-form text inputs are semantically represented by `<textarea>` element if you're
not doing incredible hacks with `<input>` or building a custom Web Component.

The introduction of HTML5 in [2014](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff) brought us a new possibility of defining
freeform text inputs using `contenteditable` attribute which is commonly found in rich-text WYSIWYG editors enumerated within a `<div>`.

Recently, I noticed that a lot of modern apps uses `<div contenteditable>` instead of `<textarea>` for their
freeform text inputs, even though they don't have and need the WYSIWYG capability `<div contenteditable>` offers.

![Bluesky is using div contenteditable instead of textarea for their freeform text input, even without WYSIWYG support](https://res.cloudinary.com/namchee/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/posts/the-quest-for-perfect-freeform-input/bsky-contenteditable)

But why is everyone steers away from good old `<textarea>`? To have a better understanding on when should we use which,
we are going to do some case study by building a freeform text input on a chatbot interface.

## Case Study: Chatbot Input

Assuming that you're not living in a cave, chatbot interface always provide the user with a freeform text input as user's
main input source for prompts.

DEMO

Aside from non text input related features like file uploads and other tools, we can imply that the text input has the following behavior:

- Accepts user text input from any medium
- Resizes the height if the input requires more than one line
- Scrolls the container if the text input has too many lines

We are going to implement all of the specifications above using `<textarea>` and `<div contenteditable>`. Finally, we compare
both implementations to find out the advantages and disadvantages of both.

### Textarea

To start accepting inputs, we don't need to do anything besides defining `<textarea>` in our document and our new element
is ready to accept user inputs.

Things gets a bit tricky when we're going to implement auto resizing on too much inputs as the `rows` and `cols` attribute.

### Contenteditable

Same with `<textarea>`, we don't need to implement anything special to our `<div>` except by adding `contenteditable` attribute
and our element is ready to accept user inputs.
