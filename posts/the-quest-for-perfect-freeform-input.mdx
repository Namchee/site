If you've ever interacted with a website or an application on your smartphone, you should be
familiar with freeform text inputs.

Unlike the traditional text inputs, free-form text inputs are capable of handling reasonably sized
multi-line plain-text inputs which is perfect for comments, feedbacks or in recent cases, inputs
for chatbots.

In a context of a website, free-form chat inputs are semantically represented by `<textarea>` element if you're
not doing incredible hacks with `<input>` or building a custom Web Component.

AN EXAMPLE OF TEXTAREA

The introduction of HTML5 in [2014](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff) brought us a new possibility of defining
freeform text inputs using `<div>` with the `contenteditable` attribute. This combination of element and attribute
is commonly found in WYSIWYG editors.

Recently, I noticed that a lot of modern apps uses `<div contenteditable>` instead of `<textarea>` for their
freeform text inputs, even though they don't have and need the WYSIWYG capability `<div contenteditable>` offers.

But why is everyone steers away from good old `<textarea>`? To have a better understanding on when should we use which,
we are going to do some case study by building a freeform text input on a chatbot interface.

## Case Study: Chatbot Input

Assuming that you're not living in a cave, chatbot interface always provide the user with a freeform text input as user's
main input source for prompts.

Judging from the demo above, the input should be capable of:

- Accepting user text input, both via standard input or speech-to-text
- Resizes the height if the input requires more than one line
- Scrolls the container if the text input exceeds more than eight lines
