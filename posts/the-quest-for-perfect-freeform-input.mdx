If you've ever interacted with a website or an application on your smartphone, you should be
familiar with freeform text inputs.

Unlike the traditional text inputs, free-form text inputs are capable of handling reasonably sized
multi-line plain-text inputs which is perfect for comments, feedbacks or in recent cases, inputs
for chatbots.

In a context of a website, free-form text inputs are semantically represented by `<textarea>` element if you're
not doing incredible hacks with `<input>` or building a custom Web Component.

AN EXAMPLE OF TEXTAREA

The introduction of HTML5 in [2014](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff) brought us a new possibility of defining
freeform text inputs using `<div>` with the `contenteditable` attribute which made users able to input anything.

This combination of element and attribute
is commonly found in WYSIWYG editors.

Recently, I noticed that a lot of modern apps uses `<div contenteditable>` instead of `<textarea>` for their
freeform text inputs, even though they don't have and need the WYSIWYG capability `<div contenteditable>` offers.

![Bluesky is using div contenteditable instead of textarea for their freeform text input, even without WYSIWYG support](https://res.cloudinary.com/namchee/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/posts/the-quest-for-perfect-freeform-input/bsky-contenteditable)



But why is everyone steers away from good old `<textarea>`? To have a better understanding on when should we use which,
we are going to do some case study by building a freeform text input on a chatbot interface.

## Case Study: Chatbot Input

Assuming that you're not living in a cave, chatbot interface always provide the user with a freeform text input as user's
main input source for prompts.

DEMO

Aside from non text input related features like file uploads and tools, we can imply the specification of the text input:

- Accepts user text input, both via standard input devices or speech-to-text
- Resizes the height if the input requires more than one line
- Scrolls the container if the text input exceeds more than eight lines

We are going to implement all of the specifications above using `<textarea>` and `<div contenteditable>`. Finally, we compare
both implementations to find out the advantages and disadvantages of both.
