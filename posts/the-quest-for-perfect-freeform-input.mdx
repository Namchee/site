If you've ever interacted with a website or an application on your smartphone, you should be
familiar with freeform text inputs.

Unlike the traditional text inputs, free-form text inputs are capable of handling reasonably sized
multi-line plain-text inputs which is perfect for comments, feedbacks or in recent cases, inputs
for chatbots.

In a context of a website, free-form chat inputs are semantically represented by `<textarea>` element if you're
not doing incredible hacks with `<input>` or building a custom Web Component.

The introduction of HTML5 in [2014](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5-diff) brought us a new possibility of defining
freeform text inputs using `<div>` with the `contenteditable` attribute. This combination of element and attribute
is commonly found in WYSIWYG editors.

Recently, I noticed that a lot of modern apps uses `<div contenteditable>` instead of `<textarea>` for their
freeform text inputs, even though they don't have WYSIWYG capability. But why is everyone steers away from
good old `<textarea>`?
