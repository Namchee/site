If you're familiar with JavaScript, I'm pretty sure you've written at least a single `Promise` in your
software development journey.

`Promise` allows you to define an asynchronous routine that will be executed in a **concurrent** manner
without blocking routines that follows it. That way, your program can stay responsive without having to
play the waiting game.

While it's really cool to run an asynchronous code, there are times where you need to wait for the asynchronous
routine to finish first before executing the next routine. Either you need whatever returned by the routine or
you need to sync up the state.

Fortunately, `Promise` allows us to 'block' the program execution
