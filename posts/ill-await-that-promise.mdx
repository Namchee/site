If you're familiar with JavaScript, I'm pretty sure you've written at least a single `Promise` in your
software development journey.

`Promise` allows you to define an asynchronous routine that will be executed in a **concurrent** manner
without blocking routines that follows it. That way, your program can stay responsive without having to
play the waiting game.

After being queued, the `Promise` may **resolve** or **reject** which is handled using the `.then` or `.catch` keyword
respectively. The syntax is further streamlined to be closer to synchronous code using `async` and `await` keyword.

## Is It a Promise Though?

`Promise` has already come a long way since its introduction in [2013](https://web.dev/articles/promises) as
a standardized way to write asynchronous code in JavaScript. However, things will start getting messy when
you're not sure with what you're dealing with.
