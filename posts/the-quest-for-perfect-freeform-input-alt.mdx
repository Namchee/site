March 2025 has brought us a new update to the web platform: the induction of `plaintext-only` value for
`contenteditable` attribute to [Widely Available Baseline](https://web.dev/blog/contenteditable-plaintext-only-baseline),
which is a prevalent attribute commonly used in WYSIWYG editors.

As the name suggest, this value will narrow down the editability of the attributed element to only accept plaintext values.

this new value?
