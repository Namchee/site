March 2025 has brought us a new update to the web platform: the induction of `plaintext-only` value for
`contenteditable` attribute to [Widely Available Baseline](https://web.dev/blog/contenteditable-plaintext-only-baseline),
which is a prevalent attribute commonly used in WYSIWYG editors.

As the name suggest, using this value will narrow down the value that may be received by the `contenteditable` element to only plaintext values.

However we already have the good old `<textarea>` to handle freeform plaintext inputs, so what is WHATWG thinking when creating
this new value?

## When Textarea Isn't Enough

Since its introduction of HTML2 in [November 1995](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/), freeform text inputs has always been traditionally
defined with the `<textarea>` element instead of `<input>`.

<figure class="my-4 w-full max-w-4/5 mx-auto">
  <textarea class="border border-separator p-2 font-mono w-full bg-background transition-colors">Hello, I'm textarea 👋</textarea>
  <figcaption class="text-xs italic text-center">An example of textarea with minimal setup</figcaption>
</figure>

From what we can infer from the element above, the main difference between `<textarea>` and `<input>` element besides the size
is the additional caret on the bottom right of the element should the user want to resize the element.

While it's pretty clear from the start that `<textarea>` does not support rich-text formatting for WYSIWYG purposes,
