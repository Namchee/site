March 2025 has brought us a new update to the web platform: the induction of `plaintext-only` value for
`contenteditable` attribute to [Widely Available Baseline](https://web.dev/blog/contenteditable-plaintext-only-baseline),
which is a prevalent attribute commonly used in WYSIWYG editors.

As the name suggest, using this value will narrow down the value that may be received by the attributed element to only plaintext values.

However we already have the good old `<textarea>` to handle multi-line plaintext inputs, so what is WHATWG thinking when creating
this new value?

## When Textarea Isn't Enough

Since its introduction of HTML2 in [November 1995](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/), multi-line text inputs has always been traditionally
defined with the `<textarea>` element instead of `<input>`.

  <textarea class="border border-separator p-2 font-mono text-opacity-50 w-full">Hello, I'm textarea!</textarea>
  <figcaption class="text-xs italic text-center">An example of textarea with minimal setup</figcaption>
</figure>
