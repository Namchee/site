        <p>
          Hello there. My name is Cristopher, but I'm commonly known as Namchee
          in the online space. I'm a software engineer based in Bandung,
          Indonesia. Currently, I create practical solutions at <TextLink
            href="https://glair.ai/"
            external
          >
            GLAIR</TextLink>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I stumbled upon the world of code when I'm searching for a way to
          cheat at a Facebook game during my junior high school days. Although I
          failed to do so, the journey serves as my first step to software
          engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside professional work, I love playing around new tech I have discovered
          during my engineering journey. Whenever I feel the burn out is approaching fast,
          you can find me playing video games with my trusty little war machine or continue
          building my <TextLink href="/bookshelf">reading habit</TextLink>.
