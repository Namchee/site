It's weekend, you're burning up and currently building a killer side project that (hopefully) make billions
in the future. You're starting of with writing a simple function for your authentication flow that transforms
a `pascalCase` string to a `snake_case` one.

```ts, title=auth.ts
// ...the rest of authentication code

function toSnakeCase(text: string): string {
	return text.split(/\.?(?=[A-Z])/)
		.join("_")
		.toLowerCase();
}
```

Nice, that's one feature down! Suddenly, you realized that you *might* need to use this function somewhere
else and duplicating the function is a no-go since you just read the [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) book.
A brilliant idea pops up on your head:

> Hey, why don't I create a file that stores these small, reusable functions that can be imported from any files?

You finally extracted this function to a separate file that you call `util.ts`, thus mark the starting point of *utility* or
*helper* file (or class / module). You are feeling that creating the utility file is the best decision you've made in this project.

```ts, title=util.ts
export function toSnakeCase(text: string): string {
	return text.split(/\.?(?=[A-Z])/)
		.join("_")
		.toLowerCase();
}
```
