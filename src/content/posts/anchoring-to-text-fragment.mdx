I'm pretty sure most of you are already familiar with the concept of **in-page links**&mdash;URLs that contain a hashbang and make the page jump to a specific marked element.
Still not familiar? Well, you can try it out by clicking links inside the table of contents on the left side of this page.

<figure class=":uno: my-4 md:-ml-4 md:w-[calc(100%+32px)] overflow-x-visible">
  <Image
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/namchee/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/posts/anchoring-to-text-fragment/toc-showcase"
    alt="What clicking the Table of Contents would do"
    title="What clicking the Table of Contents would do"
    width={670}
    height={343}
    class=":uno: rounded-md"
  />

  <figcaption class=":uno: text-xs mt-2 text-center italic">
    What clicking links in the Table of Contents would do
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The main use case of in-page links is to allow users to quickly navigate lengthy pages to a section of interest which in turn will increase UX and SEO-wise,
increase discoverability and engagement that might increase user conversion rates.

Implementing in-page links is pretty simple, all you need to do is to mark the section of interest with `id` and append a `#<id>` to your links.

```html title=URL Fragment 101, noLang
<!-- say, you want to jump directly to this section on navigate -->
<div id="section-of-interest">
	You just got coconut mall'ed
</div>

<!-- on the same page, you can jump to this section just by hash + id -->
<a href="#section-of-interest">Wanna have some fun?</a>

<!-- on different page, append the path with hash + id -->
<a href="/cool-page#section-of-interest">Wanna have some fun?</a>

<!-- when sharing to external source, again, just append hash + id -->
https://www.your-site.com/cool-page#section-of-interest
```

## Jumping To Text?

But let's say one day you want to create a link that allows users to jump a specific text instead of marked sections.
Well easy, just mark the text in a `<span>` and give it a unique `id` to them! Unfortunately, it doesn't scale for the following reasons:

- The solution only works if you have full control over the content. It doesn't work for third-party generated content, whether from users or these days, LLMs
- More elements means adding unnecessary complexity. Need to add words to the marked text? What if the `id` is invalid? Well, you have to modify the code again!

Since using standard element fragment clearly doesn't scale well, we can try using JavaScript to solve the problem which should look similar to the following

```js title=scroll-to-text.js
const targetText = `coconut mall'ed`;

// let's say the text is always a descendant of this element
const container = document.querySelector('.content');

// Create a TreeWalker, which is more efficient than iterating nodes recursively
const walker = document.createTreeWalker(container, NodeFilter.SHOW_TEXT);

let node = null;

while (walker.nextNode()) {
	if (walker.currentNode.nodeValue.includes(targetText)) {
		node = walker.currentNode;
		break;
	}
}

if (node && node.parentElement) {
	// can't scroll directly to text, so we scroll to the nearest ancestor
	// which is the parent of course
	node.parentElement.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' });
}
```

Unfortunately, this means another reliance on JavaScript. What if your user disables JavaScript? What if you want to reduce JavaScript footprint in your site? Or maybe
[you've had enough of JavaScript](https://www.globalnerdy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/javascript-is-olive-oil-for-developers.jpg)?

Turns out, TC39 has addressed this by introducing [URL Fragment Text Directives](https://wicg.github.io/scroll-to-text-fragment/), [first introduced to the public
in 2020](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280115/google-search-engine-yellow-highlight-featured-snippet-anchor-text) and finally hit stable status in 2023.

## Dissecting the API

Similar to element fragment, you can insert text fragments into a URL using a hashbang with the following syntax (psst, try to interact with your pointers!):

<TextFragmentApi client:only />

While it does look similar to your standard element fragment, there are few key differences besides stricter format:

- All inputs within this directive must be [percent-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent)
	even for normally URL-safe characters such as dashes. This means building text fragments with `encodeURIComponent` isn't enough to do the trick.
- Each part of the syntax must reside inside one [block-level element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content),
	however the whole match may span across multiple blocks.
- It's possible to define multiple text fragments by separating them with `&` just like what you usually do with query strings. [Example](#:~:text=separating&text=query)
- Instead of styling the fragment with `:target` pseudo-class, the text fragments are styled with `::target-text` pseudo-element.
	By default, the browser will style text fragments with the same default style as `<mark>`.

When browsers received a navigation to a URL that contains text fragment(s), it will try to find texts that matches the directive **even if they're visually hidden**.

If a text matching the fragment is found, the browser will scroll to and highlight the first matching fragment. If no match is found, the browser will do nothing.

### Interaction With Element Fragment

Since text fragment occupies the same hashbang spot as element fragment, you might be wondering if it's possible to combine them both. Actually, you can!
You only need to append the text fragment directive after element fragment. For example:

<TextLink class="font-mono text-heading text-center my-4" href="#jumping-to-text:~:text=since,scale%20well">#jumping-to-text:~:text=since,scale%20well</TextLink>

Do note that when the text fragment doesn't share the same viewspace as the element fragment, the element fragment will be ignored and the browser
will prioritize scrolling to the text fragment as demonstrated by [this link](#jumping-to-text:~:text=but%20as%20a%20good%20developer,browsers).

## Is It A 'Navigation'?

After reading the features and API specification above, you might think this API solves a use case you need for your app.
You have played around with it in an isolated environment and finds out that it works as you expected.

You then ported the functionality to your app that uses a client-side navigation with [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API)
which should look similar to the following:

```js title=Text fragment directive with History API. Surely nothing could go wrong!
const targetText = `coconut mall'ed`;

if (window.history) {
	const fragment = encodeURIComponent(targetText);
	const url = `/cool-page#:~:text=${fragment}`;

	window.history.pushState(null, '', url);
}
```

Unfortunately, you'll find out that the text fragment doesn't work and the page just navigates normally.
This is an expected behavior, as the text fragment directive only triggers on **user-initiated navigations**.

Simply put, only navigations triggered via browser's back-forward buttons and through HTML elements that supports navigation such as
`<a>` and `<form>` that will trigger browser's behavior of text fragment directive.

For those of you that programmatically navigates using JavaScript, your only option to replicate the text fragment directive behavior is using JavaScript.

> Please consult to the [Navigation API Appendix](https://github.com/WICG/navigation-api#appendix-types-of-navigations) for more information about which navigation counts as user-initiated or not.

## Extracting The Fragment

Suppose that you want to retrieve the text directive programmatically, either for analytical purposes or to
alter specific scrolling behavior, such as disabling scroll-to-bottom when a text fragment directive is present.

Well, since the directives are stored in hash bangs, we should be able to read the `hash` property from `URL` and parse it from there no?

```js title=Extracting text fragment directive that definitely don't work
// suppose that the the current URL is `/cool-page#:~:`
const hash = window.location.hash;
const textFragment = hash.match(/:~:text=(.+):/);

if (textFragment) {
	const fragments = textFragment[1]
		.split('&') // account for possible multi-fragment
		.map((fragment) => decodeURIComponent(fragment));

	console.log(fragments); // it's empty?
}
```

Unfortunately, you can't retrieve text fragments from `hash` as per the WICG specification,
[text fragment directives should be hidden and won't be exposed to user agents](https://wicg.github.io/scroll-to-text-fragment/#:~:text=to%20prevent%20impacting%20page%20operation).

This behavior is made to maintain compatibility with hash-based navigations used in old client-side navigation library (old React Router anyone?).
While there is [acknowledged need of it](https://github.com/WICG/scroll-to-text-fragment/issues/128), it's still not progressing anywhere.

> At the time of writing, there's an [acknowledged bug](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40136467) in Chromium-based browsers that allows you to retrieve text fragment directive by exploiting the **Performance API**,
> specifically by parsing `PerformanceNavigationTiming` interface.
>
> ```js title=Extracting text fragment directive that works (on Chromium browsers),copy
> const navigationEvent = performance
> 	.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0];
>
> // Should be `PerformanceNavigationTiming`
> const hash = new URL(navigationEvent.name).hash;
> // Match until the next possible directive
> const textFragment = hash.match(/:~:text=(.+):/);
>
> if (textFragment) {
>	const fragments = textFragment[1]
>		.split('&') // account for possible multi-fragment
>		.map((fragment) => decodeURIComponent(fragment));
>
>	console.log(fragments); // it's NOT empty 🎉
> }
> ```
>
> But as a good developer, you shouldn't rely on a *bug* even if you're only targeting Chromium-based browsers.

## Security & Privacy

Text fragment directive can be created by anyone who has access to your website so it's a reasonable concern to consider its security and privacy implications.

While in the [previous section](#dissecting-the-api) I wrote that text fragment directive works on user-activated navigations, there is one more requirement
that the directive should fulfill: cross-origin requests should happen in `noopener` context which ensures the target page to be isolated.

This context requirements ensures that the directive won't be invoked from a `<iframe>` navigation and texts won't be searched inside an `<iframe>`.
While text fragment directive does look secure from a glance, the directive does open [a new attack vector related with scrolling](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YHcl1-vE_ZnZ0kL2almeikAj2gkwCq8_5xwIae7PVik/edit?tab=t.0).

This possible attack vector has raised privacy concerns, leading Brave to [temporarily disable this directive](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/8342) which has been re-enabled on
[version 1.78](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/44265) which should be released by the time this post goes public.

If you're in full-control of your site, you can tell the browser to not process **any** fragments site-wide by setting
the `Document-Policy` header with the following value.

```plaintext title=Enforce the page to ignore fragments including element fragment, noLang
Document-Policy: force-load-at-top
```

For enterprise environments that uses Chrome, network administrators may also disable text fragments by setting the `ScrollToTextFragmentPolicy` policy.

## Final Thoughts

When I first learned about this feature after Google introduced it in Google Search by highlighting the search result after navigation,
I thought that this was yet another API that [will be killed sooner or later](https://killedbygoogle.com/).

Imagine my joy when I found out that the feature is alive through a WICG proposal. It solves my major gripe with element fragments = over-reliance
to stable link structure and mandatory element wrapping while enabling us to create a higher-quality citation and reference links.

While crafting the URL manually is tedious, you don't need to worry as this concern has been addressed with web extensions for
[Chromium-based browsers](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/link-to-text-fragment/pbcodcjpfjdpcineamnnmbkkmkdpajjg),
[Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/link-to-text-fragment/pmdldpbcbobaamgkpkghjigngamlolag),
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/link-to-text-fragment/), and
[Safari](https://apps.apple.com/app/link-to-text-fragment/id1532224396). Happy (deep)linking!
