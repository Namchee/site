Last March, I found out an interesting feedback when I was scouring through tester feedbacks for a large-scale project that my team have been working on.
The feedback reads the following:

> The font is too thin, causing eye strains for long-text reading.

When I first read this feedback, I was wondering if our UI design team screwed up somehow and went to look up the mockup in Figma and compare it with the implementation.
Unfortunately, I didn't find an answer I was hoping for as the font satisfies the design specification while being reasonably readable.

One small thing that noticed though was the font looks a bit clearer on my end compared to the attached screenshot,
so I tried to look at the finer details of the issue report and replicate the reporter environment.
The browser settings were stock, no plugins that might interfere with rendering, and switching browsers didn't help.

That just leave the OS, since the reporter was using a Windows machine while I mostly dabble on Ubuntu.
Funnily enough, switching OS revealed that the said text consistently had worse readability compared to how it looks on my Ubuntu environment.

This discovery made me wonder on the actual root cause of the issue and I began tweaking my Windows to simulate text rendering on my Ubuntu.
Tweaking our beloved [ClearType](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/cleartype/) yields no result and adding non-standard CSS properties such as
[`font-smooth`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-smooth) didn't do anything either.

And the funniest part was, opening Figma in my Windows machine to take a closer look to the font revelated that the text is rendered differently
in Figma App and the browser with Figma being more similar to how the font rendered on Ubuntu.

After some digging to lower level APIs, I found out that the reason why this happens is because OSes have different font rendering engine similar to
how browsers [have multiple standards that causes headaches to web developers](https://preview.redd.it/safari-is-such-a-pain-v0-djbncqoaz9va1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=3991a6687ffc318ada838a471aab86160bc202a6)
that controls how texts are displayed to users.

To have more context of the problem, we're going to dive deeper on fonts in digital space, how they are made and how programs parse and render them as texts.

## A Primer of Font Terminologies

Before getting to the meat of the problem, we need to clarify some of terminologies we usually use to describe typography as they're commonly mixed up with each other:
