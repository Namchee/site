After 3 years of my career as professional software engineer, I finally decided it's time for me to write and share my journey in the world of software engineering through this website.

I know, I'm very late in the blogging game and people might ask `But why? Why now instead X years ago? What motivates you to do this?`

## A Flashback to the Past

Some of you might know that I actually have my own personal website in the end of 2021. The website itself contains nothing but a little bit of introduction and a showcase of personal projects.

Looking back, the main reason I build my previous website is to showcase my (obviously lacking) skills in web development. But in reality, I treated it as my own personal playground to test out
experimental ideas that pops in my head from time to time. There was no commitment of keeping it alive since it's just a bunch of random ideas and whatever trends mashed up together. In the end,
I feel like the old personal website doesn't help me grow as a software engineer, so I decided to abandon it and re-build my personal wesbite from scratch.

You might wonder why it doesn't help me grow at all even though it's a personal playground. Part of the reason is there isn't any commitment on the table. But the most important reason is
I learnt nothing from it.

## Learning in Public

The primary reason I started this website and write is for learning purposes and recently, I found out that the best ways to do it is by <TextLink external href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public">learning in public</TextLink>.
