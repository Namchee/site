Test. Such is the word that becomes the bane of many software developers worldwide.

Writing tests are something that good software developers can't ignore when developing high-quality softwares.
If you still think that tests aren't important, I suggest that you take a look at [Ariane 5 rocket crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6PWATvLQCY) that
costs 360 million US dollars

due to numeric value conversion.

This incident raises the awareness of software testing to produce higher quality and less buggy softwares.

While it does look like an inside joke from Twitter for software engineers, the tweet above exposes a **dangerous misconception** commonly present
in the mind of software engineers: *more test -> better coverage -> better test quality -> better softwares -> happy customers -> ~~more money~~*.

This misconception is usually present &mdash; but not limited to &mdash; in inexperienced software engineers when
writing their first test. To understand why more tests aren't equal to better softwares, we need to understand the basic concept of **test coverage**.
