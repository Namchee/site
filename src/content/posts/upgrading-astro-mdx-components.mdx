Markdown is commonly used to store textual contents when building a site with Astro. During the build process, Astro will take
all markdowns transform them into its HTML equivalent. Users can then style the markups with CSS however they wish.

However, customization through CSS is pretty limited as customizing the actual markup or behavior is out of the table. To allow
greater degree of customization, users can opt-in to [MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/).

MDX allows users to utilize custom components with markup-like syntax similar to how we use those components in Astro files or JSX.

```markdown title=Using custom components in MDX
---
title: 'Hello World!'
publishedAt: 2024-12-17
---
import MyComponent from 'path/to/component.astro';

<MyComponent>
  Hello World!
</MyComponent>
```

However, this is impractical when users want to replace default elements as they
are forced to use JSX-like syntax for every element and lose the simplicity of defining elements in markdown.

Fortunately, MDX also allows users to re-map HTML elements into custom components
by exporting component map in MDX files as `components` constant.


```markdown title=Replacing default elements with custom elements
---
title: 'Hello World!'
publishedAt: 2024-12-17
---

import Head1 from '../../components/Head1.astro';

export const components = {
  // Replace <h1> with Head1
  h1: Head1,
}
```

After seeing the syntax, you might be wondering: how do I manage the props? What attributes are passed to the mapped element?
Can I apply a pre-defined CSS classes to mapped elements?

Unfortunately, it seems that [Astro's MDX integration documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) only touches
the surface of this syntax and the [official MDX documentation](https://mdxjs.com/table-of-components/) only tells you about what elements
that can be re-mapped.

This post will guide you through customizing default markdown elements using the `components` syntax. We will using the default code snippets
component as the guinea pig and upgrade them into the code snippets that you see in this site.

![The default snippet. Looks great, but can we make it even better?](https://res.cloudinary.com/namchee/image/upload/v1734152131/posts/supercharing-astro-code-snippet/default-snippet.png)

## Deconstructing the Code Snippet

Before moving on to the actual customization of the snippet, we need to understand how Astro handles markdown files.

For each markdown file, Astro will parse the content using a processor called [remark](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/packages/markdown/remark),  which is a part of the
[unified](https://unifiedjs.com/) toolchain. From the markdown, remark will produce an [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) (AST). The AST will
then be transformed into HTML tags using another processor in the same toolchain: [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype).

<Quote>
  You might be wondering why we need to transform the markdown into an AST and not directly use something like RegExp.

	<br />

  This is because markdown (and HTML) is not a [regular language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language). Trying to parse non-regular language with **regular** tends to be error prone.
</Quote>

The functionality of remark and rehype can be augmented using [plugins](https://unifiedjs.com/learn/guide/create-a-rehype-plugin/) that provides additional features,
such as custom syntax and syntax highlighting.

By default, Astro enables [GitHub-flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and [SmartyPants](https://github.com/silvenon/remark-smartypants)
plugin to extend the basic markdown syntax. For syntax highlighting, Astro uses [Shiki](https://shiki.matsu.io/packages/rehype) by default or
users can opt-in to [Prism](https://prismjs.com/).

The diagram below shows a simplified pipeline of markdown transformation to HTML that occurs during the build process.

	Markdown --> astro[Astro Compiler]
	astro --> remark[Remark + Plugins]
	remark -- AST --> rehype(Rehype + Plugins)
	rehype -- HTML tags --> astro
	astro --> page(HTML page)
```

When processing code blocks, the process above will output HTML tags similar to the following:

```html title=Example HTML output of a code block. Looks pretty complex isn't it?, no-lang
<pre class="astro-code github-dark" style="background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8;overflow-x:auto" tabindex="0" data-language="js">
	<code>
		<span class="line">
			<span style="color:#F97583">&lt;!</span>
			<span style="color:#E1E4E8">doctype html</span>
			<span style="color:#F97583">&gt;</span>
		</span>
		<span class="line">
			<span style="color:#E1E4E8">&lt;</span>
			<span style="color:#85E89D">html</span>
			<span style="color:#B392F0"> lang</span>
			<span style="color:#F97583">=</span><span style="color:#9ECBFF">"en"</span>
			<span style="color:#E1E4E8">&gt;</span>
		</span>
		<span class="line">
			<span style="color:#E1E4E8">  &lt;</span>
			<span style="color:#85E89D">head</span>
			<span style="color:#E1E4E8">&gt;</span>
		</span>
		<!-- and the rest of the tags -->
	</code>
</pre>
```

This HTML tags will then be used by Astro to replace code blocks during the markdown
transformation process into an HTML page for:

<dl class=":uno: space-y-2">
  <ListTitle class="font-normal">
    All code fences (\`\`\`) defined in Markdown and MDX files.
  </ListTitle>
  <ListTitle class="font-normal">
    Content defined with [`<Code />`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/syntax-highlighting/#code-) or [`<Prism />`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/syntax-highlighting/#prism-) component.
  </ListTitle>
</dl>

## Replacing The Default Code Snippet

Our first step to customize the code snippet is by replacing the default component with
a custom component that wraps the original one using Astro [`<slot />`](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/#slots).

To do that, we can assign a custom mapping for HTML elements by exporting a new constant
called `components` in our MDX files.

```markdown title=hello-world.mdx
---
title: 'Hello World!'
publishedAt: 2024-12-17
---

import CodeSnippet from '../../components/CodeSnippet.astro';

export const components = { // [!code highlight]
	// in MDX, code snippets are defined with <pre>  // [!code highlight]
	pre: CodeSnippet, // [!code highlight]
} // [!code highlight]
```

We can then define `CodeSnippet` as:

```astro title=CodeSnippet.astro
<figure>
	<figcaption>
		This is a caption
	</figcaption>

	<slot />
</figure>

```

Save the file and we will be greeted by this weird element.

![Well... that was unexpected](https://res.cloudinary.com/namchee/image/upload/v1734274270/posts/supercharing-astro-code-snippet/first-try.png)

So what's happening here? Why does wrapping the code block in a `<figure>` element ruins the structure entirely? Well it turns out, we replaced
the entire `<pre>` element with `<figure>` as shown in the following snippet.

```html title=Should we replace the <pre>?
<figure>
	<figcaption>
		This is a caption
	</figcaption>

	<code>
		<span class="line">
			<span style="color:#F97583">&lt;!</span>
			<span style="color:#E1E4E8">doctype html</span>
			<span style="color:#F97583">&gt;</span>
		</span>
		<span class="line">
			<span style="color:#E1E4E8">&lt;</span>
			<span style="color:#85E89D">html</span>
			<span style="color:#B392F0"> lang</span>
			<span style="color:#F97583">=</span><span style="color:#9ECBFF">"en"</span>
			<span style="color:#E1E4E8">&gt;</span>
		</span>
		<span class="line">
			<span style="color:#E1E4E8">  &lt;</span>
			<span style="color:#85E89D">head</span>
			<span style="color:#E1E4E8">&gt;</span>
		</span>
		<!-- and the rest of the tags -->
	</code>
</figure>
```

Well, that's **not** what we wanted at all! We don't want to remove the `<pre>` entirely as we need to preserve
the preformatted styling. After wrapping the `<code>` block inside a `<pre>` element, the previously
butchered element will look like this.

![Look ma! I restored the formatting!](https://res.cloudinary.com/namchee/image/upload/v1734770479/posts/supercharing-astro-code-snippet/second-try.png)

We've restored the formatting at this point, but we're still missing the theming from the original component. Obviously, we can apply the intended class, style, and other attributes to the `<pre>` element directly.
However, this means that we wasted the theming we've done from Astro's config entirely.

Fortunately, since the custom component is implemented as an Astro component, Astro treats those passed attributes as **component props** which is
provided by `Astro.slot` globals.

```astro title=CodeSnippet.astro
---
const props = Astro.props; // [!code highlight]
---

<figure>
    <figcaption>
        This is a caption
    </figcaption>

    <pre {...props}><slot /></pre> // [!code highlight]
</figure>

```

which results in

![Passing the `props` surely do the trick](https://res.cloudinary.com/namchee/image/upload/v1734792284/posts/supercharing-astro-code-snippet/third-try.png)

We did it! We've successfully rendered a custom code snippet component without breaking the existing components. We can now begin customizing the component.
