## Some Random Title

Diam nisl sit volutpat est pellentesque aliquet porttitor egestas commodo. Purus vitae egestas nunc turpis urna placerat proin dui mi. Iaculis sed in dui nisl. Hendrerit odio lectus enim vitae euismod enim. Urna lorem scelerisque nunc leo nunc odio mauris sed sed. Pharetra cras aenean tincidunt morbi purus molestie.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur. Vitae amet tortor bibendum sit cursus et nisi non. Sagittis aliquet augue purus dignissim. Sodales pellentesque felis eleifend tristique molestie. Accumsan amet erat mauris consequat urna fames felis et sed.

```ts title=This is a sample code snippet, copyable
function testAdd() {
  const a = 1;
  const b = 1;
  const c = 3; // [!code highlight]

  const d = 4;

  const f = 10;
  const t1 = 122;
  expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(2); // this should be true btw
}
```

## The Feedback Loop

Professionals who strive to excel in their respective fields know that learning is a lifetime process. As an aspiring software engineer,
I understand this and truly enjoy the continuous learning process every day. However, what I failed to recognize during my previous journey was the type
of learning I was doing &mdash; **learning in private**.

While learning in private isn't necessarily bad, it's not the kind of learning that boosts your growth. By learning in private, you walled yourself out
from the community and missed out on feedback.

Embarking on a learning journey can feel daunting, and having something that got your back is crucial. It's normal to lack knowledge or expertise in the subject you're learning
or to want to expand your understanding. The quickest way to gain knowledge or expertise is by learning from someone or something with more experience, either directly
or indirectly. However, this is not possible if you walled yourself out from the community by learning in private.

Now another problem arises â€” how could you get another entity to bestow you the knowledge you seek? Doing it passively by enclosing yourself in your personal haven won't work
since nobody will bat an eye if you are a nobody, which is expected when you're still on the first step of your learning journey. Even if you are not a nobody, no one
will bat an eye since they don't know what you are trying to achieve. In conclusion, the best way to do this is by actively **sharing** what you are currently doing,
which is the core concept of learning in public.

By **continously sharing** what you are learning in public, you can **continuously receive feedback** to fuel up your learning cycle and grow continuously.

As a software engineer, learning in public doesn't just mean open-sourcing whatever you're working on and leaving it as-is. Software engineers must also involve
themselves in the community by opening themselves to feedback, which is missing from my approach to learning in my previous attempt.

## The Blueprint

Moving on from the philosophical part of this post, I want this website to be my personal platform to learn in public. Specifically, this website will serve as:

<dl class=":uno: space-y-6">
  <ListTitle>
    Knowledge Base
  </ListTitle>
  <ListItem>
    Imagine having a personal library that stores records of all your experiences. Whenever I encounter a problem, I can trace back my logs and check if I have solved similar
    issues in the past. Not only will it help me resolve my issue faster by reducing redundancy, scouring past logs will also enable others who might encounter similar problems
    to solve them. In the end, everyone is happy!
  </ListItem>

  <ListTitle>
    Code Playground
  </ListTitle>
  <ListItem>
    Since I found my past experiments to be insightful, I will continue my code playground and share ideas or experiments I've conducted as either code snippets or posts.
    Hopefully, I can test out my ideas and sharpen them through public feedback. Don't be shy to drop feedback!
  </ListItem>

  <ListTitle>Giving Back Platform</ListTitle>
  <ListItem>
    I owe a lot for my current position to the open-source community. This website and all its contents will serve as a thank-you letter to the open-source community
    and keep the open-source spirit alive.
  </ListItem>

  <ListTitle>Productive Distraction</ListTitle>
  <ListItem>
    In the past, I used to play too much video games during my free time. However, I later realized that this activity was unproductive for my growth as a software engineer.
    Therefore, I vow to replace it with more productive habits by maintaining this website.
  </ListItem>

## Final Thoughts

With that in mind, I hope that everyone, including you who is reading this, can continuously learn and grow through this website.

I know, I'm very late in the blogging game when a lot of people already started learning in public early in their careers. However, I believe that it is better to start late than never start at all. Cheers!
