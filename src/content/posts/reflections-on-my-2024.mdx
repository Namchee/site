It's been 13 months since I wrote my [first blogpost](https://www.namchee.dev/posts/hello-world/) in 2023 and we're in 2025 already.
If you do the math, that's a 2 year gap between the blog debut and this year. What's happening on my 2024?

## Growing This Website

When I first started this website in the end of 2023, it didn't have a design system yet. Back then, I only standardized the color scheme and the font family that would be used.
The rest of it was just *how should the website generally look like*.

As I began pouring more content in this website, I realized that not having a design system slows down my pace as I began to notice the discrepancies between pages.
Today it might be the color that's a bit off, but the next day it might be the spacing. This can be a source of annoyance for some keen viewers.

Realizing this, I spent a lot of time building a [more concrete design system](https://github.com/Namchee/site/pull/56) for this website and some branding stuff
such as [dynamic OG images](https://github.com/Namchee/site/pull/38). I'm pretty happy with the result as I'm not overthinking about styling anymore and can focus on the content of this site.

![The current state of the design file. While there's still room for improvements, it's servicable and systematic](https://res.cloudinary.com/namchee/image/upload/v1736691416/posts/reflections-on-my-2024/design-file.png)

Speaking of content, I wrote [3](https://www.namchee.dev/posts/embracing-code-coverage-effectively/) [blog](https://www.namchee.dev/posts/utilpocalypse/)[post](https://www.namchee.dev/posts/upgrading-astro-code-snippets/) in 2024.
All engineering, but with varying topics. It's not much, but I think it's a good start.

## Open Source Activities

My biggest open source contribution in 2024 is to [e18e](https://e18e.dev/), which is an initiative to 'fix' the performance issue in the JavaScript ecosystem which I stumbled upon from X.

<Tweet id="1806684617740587331" />

While I don't do the heavy lifting like being the maintainer of the initiative or developing an alternative library, I've done my part by
[migrating an obsolete dependency](https://e18e.dev/blog/october-contributions-showcase.html#strip-ansi) on various high-profile repositories.
In the process, I learned quite a lot from the inner workings of the projects I've contributed.

I honestly didn't expect much from e18e at the beginning but I'm happy that this community exceeds my expectations. Not only as a place to coordinate the initiative,
I've 'stolen' a lot of libraries and technique that I didn't know existed just from hanging out in the [Discord server](https://chat.e18e.dev/).

In short, I've regarded e18e as a place where developers that cares about the state of JavaScript gathers and I pray for the success of this initiative.
Don't be shy to join us as we don't bite newcomers (at least I think [patak](https://patak.dev/) and [43081j](https://43081j.com/) don't)

Besides contributing to community initiatives, I've also created some side projects:

    [j2v](https://github.com/Namchee/j2v)
  </DescriptionTerm>
  <DescriptionItem>
    **j2v** is a small CLI tool that helps you migrate your [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) test suite
    to [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) automatically via codemods.

    I initally made this for my company, but I decided to share it to public.

    [astro-subfont](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@namchee/astro-subfont)
  </DescriptionTerm>
  <DescriptionItem>
    **astro-subfont** is a plugin for Astro that optimizes your typefaces by [subsetting](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/subsetting)
    it based on the build output using [subfont](https://github.com/Munter/subfont).

    This integration is used on this website!

    [instablitz](https://github.com/Namchee/instablitz)
  </DescriptionTerm>
  <DescriptionItem>
    **instablitz** is a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) plugin that exports your workspace
    to [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/) directly from your IDE.

  <DescriptionTerm>
    [tailwind-pointer-queries](https://github.com/Namchee/instablitz)
  </DescriptionTerm>
  <DescriptionItem>
    **tailwind-pointer-queries** is a work-in-progress [TailwincCSS]() plugin that adds the missing
    [CSS pointer query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/pointer) as a [variant](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins).

    Since I've found out some more niche [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries)
    that isn't present as a Tailwind variant, I'm planning to expand the scope of the project to add those missing queries.

## New Hardware

In February 2024, I short-circuited my G14 laptop by accident when I was trying to replace the thermal paste due to high temps.
I was devastated by this as its my one-and-only device and the repair cost is almost exactly the same as buying a new one.

Since I don't think it's wise to spend a lot of money to re-buy my laptop, I have to settle with
using only my work device to code. This incident made me vow to not buy a laptop as my main developer device.

On September 2024, I finally decided to treat myself by building a PC that serves as my primary device for coding.

![The parts I used to build my PC](https://res.cloudinary.com/namchee/image/upload/q_auto,w_1024/v1736767488/posts/reflections-on-my-2024/pc-parts)

Aside from building my own PC, I also decided to upgrade my workspace peripherals that I used as my daily driver, namely a 27 inch IPS monitor and
a programmable hot-swappable mechanical keyboard.

While I'm quite skeptical at first, the ergonomics that these new peripherals bring are simply unbeatable compared
to peripherals that I used previously, which in turn made me more comfortable during long coding sessions.

## Advent of TypeScript

Finally, I closed the year by participating in [Advent of TypeScript](https://www.adventofts.com/events/2024), which basically an [Advent of Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code)
but designed to be tackled via [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) type system. My participation isn't for the first time as I've joined the [first Advent of TypeScript](https://www.adventofts.com/events/2023).

The 2024 event is more focused on the practicality of the type system that can be used in real-life projects as opposed to esotericism during the 2023 event.

The day that really made an impression on me is the [23rd](https://www.adventofts.com/events/2024/23) and [24th](https://www.adventofts.com/events/2024/24) day challenge when
we are challenged to write a higher-order function in the type system. I personally don't know that it's possible to do this with just the type system!

In the end, I also placed quite high in the final leaderboard, but I think what matters the most is the knowledge that I gained from doing this event. So, I want to say
thanks to [trash](https://x.com/trashh_dev) and the [TypeHero](https://typehero.dev/) team for organizing this event!

## Regrets of 2024

While I think that 2024 is a pretty good year for both my career and personal life, I do have some regrets that I want to prevent in 2025

  <DescriptionTerm>
    Not Building Enough Personal Branding
  </DescriptionTerm>

  <DescriptionItem>
    In my first blogpost, I [stated that I want to use this website as my learning-in-public platform](http://localhost:4321/posts/hello-world#the-feedback-loop), I realized that I didn't do
    much in terms of being public which is proven by site metrics provided by [Umami](https://umami.is/)

    ![namchee.dev metrics in 2024. Notice that it only spiked on the end of 2024](https://res.cloudinary.com/namchee/image/upload/v1736866238/posts/reflections-on-my-2024/site-metrics.png)

    While I do learn a lot of things in span of 2024, I only shared those insights in a closed Discord environment and didn't fully utilize my social media accounts ([Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/namchee.dev), after migrating from X)
    to the fullest.

    The number of blog posts that I wrote in 2024 also didn't contribute much to my personal branding, as I rarely published anything, even though I have a lot of topics to write about in my backlog.

    Looking back, the main reason why I didn't publish much is because I became too focused on the quality and uniqueness of my contents, to the point where I ended up not publishing anything at all.

    Instead, I should have focused on writing and publishing posts first, leaving improvements for later.
    After all, I'm in full control of this website, so I shouldn't feel blocked when trying to edit existing contents.

## Final Thoughts

And that's a wrap for 2024!
